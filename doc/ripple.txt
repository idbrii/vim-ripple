*ripple.txt*  A REPL inside vim

Authors:  hsitz and pydave

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

INTRODUCTION                                          *ripple*

Ripple is a REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) plugin for vim. It allows
you to write code in a vim buffer and execute it from that buffer. The
results will be appended to the buffer. You can write both single lines of
code and blocks. Ripple can support any language with native vim
bindings.

COMPATIBILITY                                  *ripple-compat*

Ripple works with Ruby, Perl, and Lua.

The global variable g:ripple_default_language can be set to 'python', 'ruby',
'perl', or 'lua'. It controls which interpreter is used to process '>>>'
commands and code blocks.  Support for each interpreter must be compiled
into your Vim.

Note also that using Perl is a little different from the other languages,
because Vim does not support Perl's 'print' or 'say' commands. Instead
'VIM::Msg' is used to specify printed output.   See `:help perl` for more.

Ripple requires a Vim executable compiled with support for the scripting
language(s) that will be used. It has been tested with Python26, Ruby1.8,
Perl 5.12, and Lua 5.1, but version should not matter.


COMMANDS                                     *ripple-commands*

                                              *ripple-:Ripple*
:Ripple [language]  Open a REPL in a new buffer with the input language. If
                    [language] is omitted, |g:ripple_default_language| is
                    used instead. If installed, this command will use
                    |itchy| to open a scratch buffer. Otherwise, it just
                    splits the window.

                                               *ripple-prompt*
In the ripple REPL, there is a prompt: '>>>'. This prompt indicates an
executable line of code.

                                                 *ripple-<CR>*
<CR>                In normal mode, <CR> evaluates the current line if it
                    is prefixed with the |ripple-prompt|. The output will be
                    printed on the next line.

                                               *ripple-i_<CR>*
<CR>                The same as the normal mode <CR>, but in insert mode.

                                             *ripple-v_<C-CR>*
<C-CR>              In visual mode, <C-CR> evaluates the current selection
                    (line-wise). It should not contain any |ripple-prompt|.
                    The output will be printed below the selection.


Commands that provide no output have the command itself mirrored as output
as confirmation that they have been processed.

You will typically want to issue Python print commands, and these can be
abbreviated with 'p' instead of 'print'.

Note: It's not part of the plugin, but an entire file of Python can be
executed with the Vim command:   pyfile <filename>.  The plugin does not
capture any output from this command, however functions defined in the file
can may then be accessed in the Vim buffer using single-line-prompt Python
commands or the block-select Python processing.

Ripple has a couple of lines defining a syntax region for error messages and
a highlight command that displays them in red.  This may be overwritten by a
syntax file that clears all syntax settings so if you want to use these you
may want to move the syntax and the highlight command to a syntax and color
file, respectively.

DEPENDENCIES                                  *ripple-depends*

Ripple uses itchy.vim, but it doesn't require it. When using itchy, the REPL
will be a scratch buffer (so vim won't expect you to save it) and will have
improved splitting behavior. Ripple recommends to enable itchy's always
split option. >
    g:itchy_always_split = 1
